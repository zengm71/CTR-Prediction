Document:

* The project is in final_project_Team25.ipynb
* The presentation is built upon the Jupyter Notebook with plugin RISE. It is a HTML file as final_project_team25_slides.html
* GCP python files: three for full data with prefix full_data, one for 100,000 sample data as sample_data_gbt_cv.py, and submit_job_to_cluster.py for submitting job to the cluster.

## Name: Param Viswanathan
### Current Focus:
* Primarily focussed on decision tree algorithm
* Trying to get the Briemanâ€™s theorem working for categorical features
* Also working on the normalization for numeric features
### Future Focus:
* Will focus on getting the hand calculation for toy example using the decision tree algorithm
* Get the decision tree algorithm working for the 100K sample set
* Get the decision tree algorithm working on GCP for the full data set. Random Forest will be an algorithm I will try to get implemented for the sample and full data set.

## Name: Michael Zeng
### Current Focus:
* Dealing with categorical features 
* Work on L1/L2 regularization in logistic regression for feature selection
* Will focus on gradient boost algorithm 
### Future Focus:
* Implement the RDD version of the toy model using the sampled data and logistic regression
* Write the python file and run it on GCP with the full dataset

## Name: Hailey Wu
### Current Focus:
* Background understanding - purpose, paper reading
